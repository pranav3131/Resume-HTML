                <h3><b>PROFILE</b></h3>
                <p><b>My name is Pranav Kad. I am a 3rd year Computer Science and Engineering student. Being into tech for
                        3 years now, I have clawed my way to learn new technologies and frameworks which are a crucial part
                        of critical software used by most businesses, banks, and companies very often as business systems to
                        run their business.</b></p>
                <p>This makes me even more eager to deep dive and learn more about technology and its usage in the real
                    world. Me being an aspiring entrepreneur makes it even more exciting to explore different spheres of
                    technology and how it can be used as leverage to create products that are valuable and relevant to
                    society.</p>
